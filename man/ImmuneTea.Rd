\description{
  Interferon gamma production and tea drinking
}
\details{
  Eleven healthy non-tea-drinking individuals were asked to
  drink five or six cups of tea a day, while ten healthy
  non-tea and non-coffee-drinkers were asked to drink the
  same amount of coffee, which has caffeine but not the
  L-theanine that is in tea. The groups were randomly
  assigned. After two weeks, blood samples were exposed to
  an antigen and production of interferon gamma was
  measured.
