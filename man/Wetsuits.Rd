\usage{data(Wetsuits)}
\format{
  A data frame with 12 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Wetsuit}}{Maximum swim velocity (m/sec) when wearing a wetsuit}
    \item{\code{NoWetsuit}}{Maximum swim velocity (m/sec) when wearing a regular bathing suit}
    \item{\code{Gender}}{Gender of swimmer: \code{F} or \code{M}}
    \item{\code{Type}}{Type of athlete: \code{swimmer} or \code{triathlete}}
  }
}
\details{
A study tested whether wearing wetsuits influences swimming velocity. 
Twelve competitive swimmers and triathletes swam 1500m at maximum speed twice each; once wearing a wetsuit and once wearing a regular bathing suit. 
The order of the trials was randomized. 
Each time, the maximum velocity in meters/sec of the swimmer was recorded.
