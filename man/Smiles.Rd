Experiment to study effect of smiling on leniency in judicial matters
}
\details{
Hecht and LeFrance conducted a study examining the effect of a smile on the
leniency of disciplinary action for wrongdoers. Participants in the
experiment took on the role of members of a college disciplinary panel
judging students accused of cheating.  For each suspect, along with a
description of the offense, a picture was provided with either a smile or
neutral facial expression.  A leniency score was calculated based on the
disciplinary decisions made by the participants.
