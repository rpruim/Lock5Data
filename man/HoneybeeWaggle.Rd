\description{
  Honeybee dance duration and distance to nesting site
}
\details{
  When honeybee scouts find a food source or a nice site
  for a new home, they communicate the location to the rest
  of the swarm by doing a "waggle dance." They point in the
  direction of the site and dance longer for sites farther
  away. The rest of the bees use the duration of the dance
  to predict distance to the site.
