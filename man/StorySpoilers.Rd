  Raitngs for stories with and without spoilers
}
\details{
  This study investigated whether a story spoiler that
  gives away the ending early diminishes suspense and hurts
  enjoyment?  For twelve different short stories, the
  study's authors created a second version in which a
  spoiler paragraph at the beginning discussed the story
  and revealed the outcome. Each version of the twelve
  stories was read by at least 30 people and rated on a 1
  to 10 scale to create an overall rating for the story,
  with higher ratings indicating greater enjoyment of the
  story.  Stories 1 to 4 were ironic twist stories, stories
  5 to 8 were mysteries, and stories 9 to 12 were literary
  stories.
