Time in darkness for mice in different environments

\usage{data(StressedMice)}
\format{
  A data frame with 14 observations on the following 2 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Time}}{Time spent in darkness (in seconds)}
    \item{\code{Environment}}{Type of environment:  \code{Enriched}  or \code{Standard}}
  }
}
\details{
In the recent study, mice were randomly assigned to either an enriched environment where there was an exercise wheel available, 
or a standard environment with no exercise options. 
After three weeks in the specified environment, for five minutes a day for two weeks, the mice were each exposed to a "mouse bully" - a mouse who was very strong, aggressive, and territorial. 
one measure of mouse anxiety is amount of time hiding in a dark compartment, with mice who are more anxious spending more time in darkness. The amount of time spent in darkness is recorded for each of the mice.
