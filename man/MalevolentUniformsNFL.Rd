\description{
Perceived malevolence of uniforms and penalies for National Football League
(NFL) teams
}
\details{
Participants with no knowledge of the teams rated the jerseys on
characteristics such as timid/aggressive, nice/mean and good/bad. The
averages of these responses produced a "malevolence" index with higher
scores signifying impressions of more malevolent uniforms. To measure
aggressiveness, the authors used the amount of penalty yards converted to
z-scores and averaged for each team over the seasons from 1970-1986.
