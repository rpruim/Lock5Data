\description{
  Water quality for a sample of lakes in Florida
}
\details{
  This dataset describes characteristics of water and fish
  samples from 53 Florida lakes.  Some variables (e.g.
  Alkalinity, pH, and Calcium) reflect the chemistry of the
  water samples. Mercury levels were recorded for a sample
  of large mouth bass selected at each lake.
