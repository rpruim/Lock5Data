\details{
In 2007 a Harvard psychologist recruited 75 female maids working in different hotels to participate in a study. She informed 41 maids (randomly chosen) that the work they do satisfies the Surgeon General's recommendations for an active lifestyle (which is true), giving them examples for how why their work is good exercise. The other 34 maids were told nothing (uninformed). Various chacteristics (weight, body mass index, ...) were recorded for each subject at the start of the experiment and again four weeks later. Maids with missing values for weight change have been removed.
