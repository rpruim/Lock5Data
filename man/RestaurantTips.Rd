  Tip data from the First Crush Bistro
}
\details{
  The owner of a bistro called First Crush in Potsdam, NY
  was interested in studying the tipping patterns of his
  customers.  He collected restaurant bills over a two week
  period that he believes provide a good sample of his
  customers. The data recorded from 157 bills include the
  amount of the bill, size of the tip, percentage tip,
  number of customers in the group, whether or not a credit
  card was used, day of the week, and a coded identity of
  the server.
