  Comparing actual movements to mental imaging movements
}
\details{
  In this study, participants were asked to either perform
  actual arm pointing motions or to mentally imagine
  equivalent arm pointing motions. Participants then
  developed muscle fatigue by holding a heavy weight out
  horizontally as long as they could. After becoming
  fatigued, they were asked to repeat the previous mental
  or actual motions. Eight participants were assigned to
  each group, and the time in seconds to complete the
  motions was measured before and after fatigue.
