  Perceived malevolence of uniforms and penalies for
  National Hockey League (NHL) teams
}
\details{
  Participants with no knowledge of the teams rated the
  jerseys on characteristics such as timid/aggressive,
  nice/mean and good/bad. The averages of these responses
  produced a "malevolence" index with higher scores
  signifying impressions of more malevolent uniforms. To
  measure aggressiveness, the authors used the amount of
  penalty minutes converted to z-scores and averaged for
  each team over the seasons from 1970-1986.
