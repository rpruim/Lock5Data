  Ant Counts on samples of different sandwiches
}
\details{
  As young students, Dominic Kelly and his friends enjoyed
  watching ants gather on pieces of sandwiches.  Later, as
  a university student, Dominic decided to study this with
  a more formal experiment. He chose three types of
  sandwich fillings (vegemite, peanut butter, and ham \&
  pickles), four types of bread (multigrain, rye, white,
  and wholemeal), and put butter on some of the sandwiches.
  \cr To conduct the experiment he randomly chose a
  sandwich, broke off a piece, and left it on the ground
  near an ant hill.  After several minutes he placed a jar
  over the sandwich bit and counteed the number of ants. He
  repeated the process, allowing time for ants to return to
  the hill after each trial, until he had two samples for
  each combination of the factors. \cr This dataset has
  only sandwiches with no butter. The data in SandwichAnts2
  adds information for samples with butter.
